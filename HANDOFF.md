# Project Handoff: Core Vision

## Project Summary
**Core Vision** is a production-grade Flutter application designed to explore "Calm Tech" principles through local-first data architecture. It features a complete CRUD system for personal reflections, an explainable pattern extraction engine that identifies behavioral trends without machine learning, and a custom design system built on "Quiet UI" guidelines. The project demonstrates advanced state management, secure local persistence, and a rigorous adherence to privacy-first engineering.

## Resume Bullet Points
- **Architected a privacy-first Flutter application** using the Repository pattern and distinct Data/Logic/UI separation, ensuring 100% local data ownership with zero external dependencies.
- **Implemented a custom "Pattern Engine"** that processes user behavioral data client-side to surface qualitative insights, prioritizing explainable heuristics over opaque ML models.
- **Designed and enforced a "Quiet UI" design system**, creating a scalable theme architecture that reduces cognitive load and adheres to strict accessibility and calm-tech standards.

## Demo Narrative (60-90 Seconds)
"This is Core Vision, a mobile application I built to explore the intersection of mental wellness and privacy engineering. 

Unlike most apps that fight for your attention, Core Vision is designed to be calm. It opens directly to your **Daily Stream**—a chronological feed of your reflections. 

Let's add an entry. I tap 'plus', and I'm in the **Reflection Interface**. Notice the 'Deep Ink' input fields—they focus the eye without shouting. I'll log that I'm feeling 'Grounded' after a 'Morning Run'. The data is saved instantly to secure local storage.

Now, navigate to the **Patterns** view via the drawer. Here, the app doesn't judge. Instead of harsh analytics, you see gentle observations like 'Often noted in the morning'. This is powered by a custom client-side engine I wrote that aggregates trends without ever sending data to a cloud.

To prove the privacy claim, I can check **Data Transparency**. This screen reveals the raw JSON stored on the device. I can copy it for my own records or, if I choose, wipe it completely with one tap. 

Core Vision demonstrates that mobile software can be powerful, personal, and beautiful, without compromising on user privacy or peace of mind."
